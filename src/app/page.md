# Welcome to my website
I have seen a few people mention the idea of a digital garden recently, and since I don't currently have the space for a real one, I thought I might give it a go. The seeds are still being planted though, so come back in a bit when there are some flowers to browse among.

## About me
Hello there! My name is Nathan, and I am a software developer/farmer/Orthodox Christian. Originally from the land of rolling meadows (England), I now live in the Carpathian Basin. The story of how I got here is mildly interesting, and maybe one day I will tell it.
