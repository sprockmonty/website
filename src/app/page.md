# Welcome to my website
I hope you enjoy your visit. At the moment, there is only one [article](/articles/declarative-dev-environments) on how to create your own portable declarative dev environment, but hopefully it's a nice article. In the future there will hopefully be more. In the meantime, maybe you would be interested in a quick look at my [resume](/resume), or maybe some of my projects (including this website) on my [github](https://github.com/sprockmonty).

## About me
Hello there! My name is Nathan, and I am a software developer/farmer/Orthodox Christian. Originally from the land of rolling meadows (England), I now live in the Carpathian Basin. The story of how I got here is mildly interesting, and maybe one day I will tell it.
